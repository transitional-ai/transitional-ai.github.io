# Research
We are a group at UNSW School of Mathematics and Statistics focusing on trans-disciplinary Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. Our group’s research encircles methodologies and applications of artificial intelligence; particularly in areas of Bayesian deep learning, climate extremes, geoscientific models, mineral exploration, language models, and biomedicine and emerging diseases.  Our key strength is in the development of novel deep-learning software frameworks with a focus on uncertainty quantification in decision-making.  

Our group is led by  [Dr Rohitash Chandra](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html) from  UNSW School of Mathematics and Statistics.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Machine learning.** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Bayesian Computation** Our focus has been on developing and applying novel Bayesian computation methods that includes variants of MCMC and variational inference for deep learning and geoscientific models. 

**Biomedicine and Bioinformatics**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Earth and Climate Science** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Remote Sensing**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.
