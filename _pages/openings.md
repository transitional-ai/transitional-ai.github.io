## Research Projects

We are currently open for HDR positions (PhD/Masters/Honours) in our group provided you bring your own scholarship or apply for UNSW PhD Scholarship. Please note UNSW PhD Scholarship is very competitive and  requires a Master's by Research thesis with a good GPA and at least a first-authored paper in a Q1 journal. More info: https://www.unsw.edu.au/research/hdr/scholarships
